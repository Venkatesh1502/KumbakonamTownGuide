<h1><u>Vaishnavism:</u></h1>
<p><b>Vaishnavism is one of the major Hindu denominations along with Shaivism, Shaktism, and Smartism. According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, the Vaishnava tradition is the largest group within Hinduism constituting about 641 million or 67.6% of Hindus. It is also called Vishnuism since it considers Vishnu as the Supreme Lord. Its followers are called Vaishnavas or Vaishnavites (derived from IAST: Vaiṣnava), and it also includes some other sub-traditions like Krishnaism and Ramaism, which consider Krishna and Rama as the Supreme being respectively.<br/>

The ancient emergence of Vaishnavism is unclear, and broadly hypothesized as a fusion of Vedic deities with various regional non-Vedic religions. It has 1st millennium BCE Vedic roots in the Vedic deity Bhaga, who gave rise to Bhagavatism, and in the Vedic water deity Nara c.q. Narayana. Non-Vedic roots are found in a merger of several popular non-Vedic theistic traditions such as the cult of Vāsudeva-Krishna and Gopala-Krishna, which developed in the 7th to 4th century BCE. In the early centuries CE, the tradition was finalized as Vaishnavism, when it developed the avatar doctrine, wherein the aligned deities are revered as distinct incarnations of supreme Vedic God Vishnu. Rama, Krishna, Narayana, Kalki, Hari, Vithoba, Venkateswara, Shrinathji, and Jagannath are among the names of popular avatars all seen as different aspects of the same supreme being.<br/>

The Vaishnavite tradition is known for the loving devotion to an avatar of Vishnu (often Krishna), and as such has been key to the spread of the Bhakti movement in South Asia in the 2nd millennium CE. It has four main categories of sampradayas (denominations, sub-schools): the medieval-era Vishishtadvaita school of Ramanuja, the Dvaita school of Madhvacharya, the Dvaitadvaita school of Nimbarkacharya, and the Pushtimarg of Vallabhacharya. Ramananda (14th century) created a Rama-oriented movement, now the largest monastic group in Asia.<br/>

Key texts in Vaishnavism include the Vedas, the Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Pancaratra (Agama) texts, Naalayira Divya Prabhandham and the Bhagavata Purana.</b></p>
